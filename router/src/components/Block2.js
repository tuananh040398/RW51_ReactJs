        According to Tonio Andrade, a historian of gunpowder technology, a "true
        gun" is defined as a firearm which shoots a bullet that fits the barrel
        as opposed to one which does not, such as the shrapnel shooting fire
        lance.[2] As such, the fire lance, which appeared between the 10th and
        12th centuries AD, as well as other early metal barrel gunpowder weapons
        have been described as "proto-guns"[14] Joseph Needham defined a type of
        firearm known as the "eruptor," which he described as a cross between a
        fire lance and a gun, as a "proto-gun" for the same reason.[15] He
        defined a fully developed firearm, a "true gun," as possessing three
        basic features: a metal barrel, gunpowder with high nitrate content, and
        a projectile that occluded the barrel.[3] The "true gun" appears to have
        emerged in late 1200s China, around 300 years after the appearance of
        the fire lance.[3][4] Although the term "gun" postdates the invention of
        firearms, historians have applied it to the earliest firearms such as
        the Heilongjiang hand cannon of 1288[16] or the vase shaped European
        cannon of 1326.[17]
