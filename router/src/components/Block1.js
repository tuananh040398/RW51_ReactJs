        Historians consider firearms to have reached the form of a "classic gun"
        in the 1480s, which persisted until the mid-18th century. This "classic"
        form displayed longer, lighter, more efficient, and more accurate design
        compared to its predecessors only 30 years prior. However this "classic"
        design changed very little for almost 300 years and cannons of the 1480s
        show little difference and surprising similarity with cannons later in
        the 1750s. This 300-year period during which the classic gun dominated
        gives it its moniker.[18] The "classic gun" has also been described as
        the "modern ordnance synthesis."[19]
